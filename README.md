# ATREIDYZ
ATREIDYZ (Antique Telescope Retrofit: Electronics Implement Declination, Yaw, and Zoom) is a project to motorize a 1967 Jason/Empire model 311 telescope with modern electronics to solve issues aligning and focusing the telescope on celestial objects through precision and automation.

## Rationale
I possess a Jason/Empire model 311 telescope, manufactured c. 1967, which is capable of magnifying celestial objects up to 280X. The telescope lenses are in good condition despite their age, but a major issue with the telescope is its mount. Because of the instability of the mount, it is difficult to aim and focus the telescope without knocking it out of alignment; even a small tap to the viewing end can cause the telescope to lose sight of a smaller celestial object such as Mars. Because this has been a repeated problem, I seek to solve it by adding motors to the telescope's mount and focusing knobs, which will allow me to precisely position the telescope and focus on whichever object I am interested in.

## Background
A refracting telescope works by capturing light from an object and bending it through two lenses separated by a given distance, called the focal length, and reflecting it into an eyepiece for an observer to see. Because of the refraction, the image will be inverted. In the case of the Jason 311, the focal length is 700 mm with a 60 mm aperture (size of fixed lens). Magnification is determined by the formula $ M = \frac{f}{f_e}$, where $f$ is the telescope focal length and $f_e$ is the eyepiece focal length. By using a higher power lens, the observer will see a more magnified image, but the image will also be dimmer and less sharp. Barlow lenses can increase magnification by artifically increasing telescope focal length, but they have the same trade-off. Each telescope has a maximum useful magnification before image quality deteriorates beyond usefulness, generally determined to be twice the aperature in millimeters. Even if a telescope has a large aperature, atmospheric turbulence and other factors can degrade the quality of images at high magnifications.
