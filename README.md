# ATREIDYZ
ATREIDYZ (Antique Telescope Retrofit: Electronics Implement Declination, Yaw, and Zoom) is a project to motorize a 1967 Jason/Empire model 311 telescope with modern electronics to solve issues aligning and focusing the telescope on celestial objects through precision and automation.

## Background:
I possess a Jason/Empire model 311 telescope, manufactured c. 1967, which is capable of magnifying celestial objects up to 280X. The telescope lenses are in good condition despite their age, but a major issue with the telescope is its mount. Because of the instability of the mount, it is difficult to aim and focus the telescope without knocking it out of alignment; even a small tap to the viewing end can cause the telescope to lose sight of a smaller celestial object such as Mars. Because this has been a repeated problem, I seek to solve it by adding motors to the telescope's mount and focusing knobs, which will allow me to precisely position the telescope and focus on whichever object I am interested in.
